# flatmaps

This package provides a set of utilities for working with cortical flat maps.

- [`surface.Surface`](flatmaps/surface.py): triangular mesh surface representation.
- [`surface.load_flat`](flatmaps/surface.py): load a [pycortex](https://github.com/gallantlab/pycortex) flat map as a `Surface`.
- [`resample.Resampler`](flatmaps/resample.py): resample data from a flat surface to a regular image grid.

pip install git+https://github.com/clane9/flatmaps.git
